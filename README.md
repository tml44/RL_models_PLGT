Code for the construction and evaluation of all RL models as described in the Methods. Fourteen models were constructed, producing 14 sets of parameters and iBIC. The optimal model included four different learning rates (εWP, εWN, εAP, and εAN) 
and two subjective impact of outcomes (ρW and ρA), action bias b, and the Pavlovian factor π. Abbreviations: Ep: Learning rate, Rh: subjective impact of outcomes, Bi: Action bias, Pav: Pavlovian factor. Model inputs require behavioral data obtained 
from PLGT performance.
